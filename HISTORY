== 1.0.0 // 2010-04-21

This is the first release of the Facets Hashery.
Most of included classes come directly from Ruby
Facets, so they have been around a while and are
in good working condition.

Some improvements are planned for the next release.
In particular the OrderHash and Dictionary, which
presently have essentially the same coding, will
diverge to target slightly different use cases.

Changes:

* Happy Birthday!
