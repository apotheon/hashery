description:
  The Hashery is a collection of Hash-like classes, spun-off
  from the original Ruby Facets library. Included are the widely
  used OrderedHash, the related but more featured Dictionary
  class, a number of open classes, similiar to the standard 
  OpenStruct and a few variations on the standard Hash.
